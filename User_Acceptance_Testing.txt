user accetance test[UAT]:-->

		1. Alpha testing
		2. Beta testing

	
	Why UAT:-->
		Here accetance means approval of agreement.
		Client conduct this testing before software goto live.

	When UAT testing conduct:-->
			After system testing and before software go to 
			production.


	Alpha testing:-->
		It is a factory level testing. during this test organization form a team
		along with [Developers, Business analyst team, test engineers] and this
		team try to findout  QA team mistakes [Defect leakage].

		What consider in alpha testing?
				
			1. Is QA testing team coverd all test areas.
			2. Is QA team followed all bylaws to test a software as 
				specified in document.

		How UAT testing conduct:-->

			Here entire team members execute acceptance testcase.
			These testcase developed by business analyst team or production team.

			
		Alpha Testing second process:-->

			It is  a factory level testing. During this test organization invite client
			team to visit organization and ask to perform Quality Control test before
			software install into client place.

			Stage1:--> Once every developed requirement meet with customer expecation
				client team request to install software at production environment.

			stage2:-->Incase client team findout any leakages organization requrest
				 some more time for software release.



		Note:--> It is final testing  that is carried out before the software goes to live,
			 Obviously this is last chance entire system to test once before software 
			 release to production.


		DEVELOPMENT ---> QA  ----> UAT  ---> PRODCUTION



	Beta testing:-->

		Users or clients involve in beta testing. During this test client recruite industry
		experts to test software.

		=> This testing conduct by two diffent category people like 
				"Model users","Real users"

		Model Users:-->
			Model user includes [Marketing team, 
			Industry experts, buyers ----etc]
					
		what is QA team job here:-->
			We should train beta testing team.


		End uses:-->
			Group of end users[people]
			Some times client release software to real 
			public as free Source.With intension to 
			findout defects with in software...
