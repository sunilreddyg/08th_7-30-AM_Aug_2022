TestPlan:-->
	After Completed reviews on test initiation document, 
	Test lead design test plan.
	It is a guideline docuemen to testing team..


	What you find in test plan?
		What to Test?
		Where to Test?
		How to Test?
		when to Test?

 Test plan ID: 
	The name of test plan document for future reference.
	for example :---> Testplan v1.0

 Introduction: 
	About corresponding project requirements or functionality

 Feature to be tested: 
	The names of requirements or functionality to be test.
	[System Testing, API testing, DB-Testing ---etc]

	The names of all requirements or functionalities or modules 
	in corresponding project.
	=> Admin Module [Creation, Updation,Delection]

 Feature not to be tested: 
	The names of tested requirements or functionality in 
	corresponding project.

	[Performance Testing, UnitTesting, Integation Testing  --etc]
	=> Types of testings not part of your team.

 Milestones:-->
	Team goals to finish day wise task.

 Approach: 
	 Test apporoach to follow by testing team
	 => Understanding client requirements
	 => Design Testcases 
	 => Review Testcases
	 => Perform Environment SmokeTesting
	 => Perform SmokeTesting
	 => Execute SystemTesting Testcase on Real Software
	 => Raise a defect if any mismatch found
	 => Execute Regression Testcase
	 => Exit the testing when 95% Testcases passed

 Test environment: 
	Required H/w and S/w to use in testing.  
	[Browser Name &  Browser version  &  Operating system]
	[Testenvironment will be setup before start system testing]

 Entry criteria: 
	[To start test execution]
 	Test cases prepared and reviewed after training sessions.
	Real test data received from client
	Test environment established by H/w team (computers S/w & H/w).
 	Received s/w build from developers.

Suspension criteria: 
	[To interrupt test execution]
	Test environment Problems (H/w problem)
	Software is not working.
	More defects are in pending by developers.

Resumption criteria:-->
	[When to resume suspended execution]
	After Environment Problemes fixed
	Previously reported defects has been fixed
	
Exit criteria: 
	(To stop test execution)
	All requirement in s/w are tested
	Test duration exceeded
	95% testcase passed
 	All major defects should be re-solved
	[Take screenshot of each test pass/fail]

 Candidate list:-->

	=> list of test engineer names who is working
		under project and their roles and responsibilites

 Tracability:-->
	=> What is current state of requirement under project
		Developement      --> Done  		100%
		Testing	          --> OnGoing		50%
		Design	     	  --> Completed		100%
		Code Reviews      --> Completed
		Testcase Review	  --> Completed

 Test deliverables: 
	The list of testing documents to be prepared by test engineer 
	for future reference [Test scenarios, test cases, 
	test logs, defect reports....)

 Resource Training: 
	The names of selected test engineers for the corresponding 
	project testing and required no. Of training sessions for 
	them to understand customers requirements.


 Team Responsibilities: 
	The work allocation to testing team
	[According to their technical skill] 

 Schedules: 
	The dates and time to be followed by test engineers.
	Future build release dates and schedules.

 Risks & Assumptions:
	assumptions: The previously analyzed list of risks and 
	solutions to overcome.
	
	What if time is exceeded?
	Perform Informal testings [Adhoc & Exploratory] testing..

 Approvals: 
	Approvals from PM.
